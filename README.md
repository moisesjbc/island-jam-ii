**Black Friday Cart Race** is an ability game programmed for the Ludum Dare #40. 

## Intro

Black Friday? Today?? Now!? Quickly! Take as many offers as you can in just a minute and then go to the cash register to get your score! But watch out! The rest of the customers will try to steal your objects! Will you reach the cash register?

Avoid customers, puddles and walls and take objects in the supermarket, you only have a minute! And remember: the more you have, the worse it is. If you have a lot of items in your cart, you’ll move slower and you won’t see your screen!
How to play
Move your character with the arrows.
Try to see something while shaking your cart with the space bar.
